## Quick Start

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zubair-trabzada/ai-crypto-claude/main/install.sh | bash
```

That's it. One command installs all 15 skills, 5 agents, and the PDF generation scripts.

## What Is This?

AI Crypto Analyst is a **research and analysis tool** built as Claude Code skills. It is **not** a trading bot. It does **not** connect to exchanges. It does **not** execute trades or manage funds.

What it does: takes a token symbol and runs a comprehensive multi-dimensional analysis using 5 parallel AI agents — on-chain, tokenomics, sentiment, technical, and fundamental — then produces a composite Crypto Score (0-100) with a clear signal (Strong Buy / Buy / Hold / Neutral / Caution / Avoid).

Run `/crypto analyze BTC` and 5 AI agents launch in parallel to produce a complete crypto research report.

No API keys. No exchange accounts. No wallet connections. Just Claude Code.

## What Makes This Different From Stock Analysis?

Crypto is fundamentally different from stocks. This tool was purpose-built for the crypto ecosystem:

| Crypto-Native Feature | Why It Matters |
|----------------------|----------------|
| **On-Chain Analytics** | Whale movements, exchange flows, active addresses, NVT ratio — data that doesn't exist in stocks |
| **Tokenomics Analysis** | Supply schedules, unlock cliffs, inflation rates, staking yields, FDV vs market cap |
| **DeFi Protocol Analysis** | TVL, protocol revenue, yield farming APRs, liquidity depth, smart contract risk |
| **Narrative/Sector Tracking** | AI, DePIN, RWA, L2, meme coin — crypto moves on narratives, not just fundamentals |
| **Token Category Detection** | Automatically adjusts analysis for L1, L2, DeFi, AI/DePIN, meme, RWA, stablecoins |
| **Crypto-Specific Risk** | Smart contract risk, rug pull indicators, regulatory exposure, liquidity depth |

| Category | Weight | What It Measures |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| On-Chain Health | 20% | Network activity, whale behavior, exchange flows, address growth |
| Tokenomics Quality | 20% | Supply mechanics, unlock risk, inflation, staking economics |
| Sentiment & Momentum | 20% | Social buzz, news tone, community engagement, Fear & Greed |
| Technical Setup | 20% | Trend, momentum, volume, pattern quality, key levels |
| Fundamental Strength | 20% | Project viability, team, adoption, competitive moat, revenue |

### Grade & Signal Interpretation

| Score | Grade | Signal | Meaning |
|-------|-------|--------|---------|
| 85-100 | A+ | Strong Buy | High conviction across all dimensions |
| 70-84 | A | Buy | Favorable setup with manageable risks |
| 55-69 | B | Hold / Accumulate | Mixed signals, wait for confirmation |
| 40-54 | C | Neutral | No clear edge, stay on sidelines |
| 25-39 | D | Caution | Significant headwinds or red flags |
| 0-24 | F | Avoid | Major red flags, high probability of loss |
